# <b>Project Description</b>

> The project task is to implement free-to-use web AR based game
> <br/>
> The main goal of the project is to provide a game that anyone can play
> <br/>
> The project was made for certain people only, meaning there is no public usage of the project
> <br/> However, the website code is free to use and modify

<br/>

# <b>Usage</b>

> In order to play the game, login is required
> <br/>
> The game is ESP based, meaning the game process can only be done via physical access to the ESP robot
> <span style = "color:rgba(255,255,255,0.5)">Please notice that the robot will only be accessible within the project area</span>

# <b>Future Plans</b>

> Turn the project into something bigger:
> <br/>
> A real vehicle will be programmed to move by keyboard from client's view, allowing the client to understand the basics of driving without the need to drive himself. It will be useful in a driving theory, of how things work.
> <br/>
> There will be couple of vehicles located at different locations within a special test area where can be placed traffic lights, fake pedestrians and more.
> <br/>
> This will solve the need of the student to pay money to learn the driving basics, including learning for theory by practicing the rules - because the vehicle is located at a special area where it cant harm anyone.
